The audience of my portfolio will mainly be potential employers or possible clients.
For this reason I tried to create a personal / professional website that conveyed a bit about me,
showcased some of my work and tried to style the website in a way that complimented this.


#Requirements
  - Needs to convey my personality & show case my recent projects and work history as the main people viewing my site will be potential employers / clients.

#Page Section ids
  - home
  - about
  - portfolio
  - contact

#Design
  - I want the design to reflect my personality whilst still giving a professional feel.
  - I used a static page with parallax features on the images used in the home & about section, achieved by setting the background image to fixed, fixing it within its container.
  - The images werecomplimented with a deep dark blue background used on the portfolio section as well as the contact page.
  - The logo of the cloud with the puzzle piece in it was to fit in with the concept of MG online solutions, the cloud represents the web and the puzzle is a metaphor for a solution.
  - Used a bootstrap featured nav-bar which is fixed to the top of the page. Also used a Jquerey function to make the nav-bar collapse into a small toggle menu bar for mobile devices, the style already given by bootstrap fit into my site nicely.
  - The nav-bar has an anchor to each section which has its own id, had to do 50px padding on each so that the nav-bar wouldn't cover the title of each section.
  - Used photoshop to make the computer image in the home / hero section got the sky image off google.
  - The buttons have favicons from font awesome link seen here -	link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css"
  - The button styles are meant to compliment the nav-bar and still stand out with the sky image as the background.
  - Used google to find the Sydney opera house photo and used photoshop to find the deep blue colour #030917 within the photo that I could use for the back-gorund of the entire site in case the images didn't load.
  - Used bootstrap cols to space the about page as well as the portfolio section so that each was mobile responsive.
  - The about section contains an image of me (which I will more than likely update) a bit about my personally and my relevant work history mainly being my clothing label.
  - The portfolio section and contact section I left with just the background colour with photos of some of the recent shirts I've designed with a link to my website on each.
  - I used white text colour so that it would stand out against the background images and colour.
